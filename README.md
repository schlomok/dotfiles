# My .dotfiles

## Installation

To install, run the following command:

`sh -c "$(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schlomok/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"`

## .vimrc

My [.vimrc](https://github.com/schlomok/vimrc) is hosted at a different 
repository because it is much larger than a singular file. It is a fork of 
[amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc).

## zsh

I use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for my zsh needs.
The .zshrc file associated assumes that oh-my-zsh is already installed. The
installer script will install oh-my-zsh for you. 

## tmux

todo: include tmux configurations
