## Installation

To install, run the following command:

`sh -c $(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schlomok/dotfiles/master/install.sh)`

## .vimrc

My [.vimrc](https://github.com/schlomok/vimrc) is hosted at a different 
repository because it is much larger than a singular file. It is a fork of 
[amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc).
